# Scope

Goal: To provide guidance for making data visualizations accessible to keyboard-only and screen reader users.

## In Scope

* Keyboard navigation for different chart types and features.
* Keyboard equivalents for mouse-based interactions for charts
* Screen reader verbiage/feedback
* Technical guidance on how to implement recommendations


## Out of scope

To help hold the line on our scope, here are things we are **not** doing, for different reasons.

### See WCAG

This lists things we are absolutely **never** covering, because it's already covered by existing WCAG spec.

* Static images. We are only looking at **interactions**. For static images, see existing best practices.
* Color contrast. We are only looking at interactions for keyboard-only and screen reader users. For color blind friendly palettes, or other coversations around color contrast, see existing best practices.
* Animations. Should your charts be animated or not? Should animations be turn-off-able? Not what we're talking about here. Valid questions that WCAG has already addressed. See existing best practices.

### Lack of expertise

Might cover it, but you'd need to reach a very high threshold for this.
* Mobile. Doesn't need to apply to *keyboard*-only anyway (unless you're using a bluetooth keyboard, in which case... just use the keyboard specifications we've already outlined??). For screen reader users... I don't believe we currently have the necessary technology to create a good, mobile-based interactions around charts, let alone one that works across multiple mobile operating systems.
